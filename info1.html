        <h2>Key Points</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Definition of Consent:</h3>
            <img src="C:\Users\acer\Desktop\login\images\7.png" alt="Description of the image">
            <p>Consent is a voluntary, enthusiastic, and clear agreement between all parties involved in any interaction. It's an ongoing process that requires active communication and mutual understanding.</p>
            <p>Consent is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ongoing: Anyone can change their mind about what they’re interested in doing, anytime</li>
                <li>Freely given: Saying ‘yes’ without pressure or manipulation</li>
                <li>Specific: Saying ‘yes’ to one act doesn’t mean you’ve said ‘yes’ to others</li>
                <li>Informed: Not deceiving or lying. For example, if someone says they’ll use a condom and then they don’t, there isn’t consent.</li>
                <li>Enthusiastic: It’s about wanting to do something, not feeling like you have to or should do something.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>Importance of Consent:</h3>
            <img src="C:\Users\acer\Desktop\login\images\8.png" alt="Description of the image">
            <p>Consent is the cornerstone of healthy relationships. It promotes mutual respect, trust, and emotional well-being. Without consent, interactions can be harmful and damaging to individuals' physical and mental health.</p>
            <p>Consent is essential:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Asking with words is often the best way to get clear consent</li>
                <li>Really listen! Anything other than a ‘heck yes!’ is a ‘no’</li>
                <li>Make space for a ‘no’. You don’t have to be excited to hear ‘no’. Using anger, pressure, or bargaining to get a ‘yes’ is not consent.</li>
                <li>‘Yes’ can change to ‘no’ at any time.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
